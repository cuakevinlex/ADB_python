# # Usage description
# Some targets may never been seen from a certain location. For example, when you're at North Pole, you can only see the stars in the northern hemisphere. However, if you are standing on the Equator, you can see the whole sky. Due to this reason, we don't want to recommend users to join projects which they can't even observe the targets in them. Therefore, use this simple script to calculate the target declination limit of a certain location.  
# 
# ### The columns you need for the databases are:  
# **U_have_E (User's equipment)**
# - longitude (deg)
# - latitude (deg)
# - altitude (m)
# - elevation limit of equipment (deg)
# 
# ### The returned value is:
# - declination lower limit (low_dec)
# 
# If low_dec < 0, the observable declination range is +90 ~ low_dec.  
# If low_dec > 0, the observable declination range is low_dec ~ -90.
